**evaluation**: rule is not violated

**scrutiny**: Upon reviewing the parameter encodings, we have the following assignments: S0 = 3'b000, S1 = 3'b001, S2 = 3'b010, S3 = 3'b011, S4 = 3'b100, S5 = 3'b101, S6 = 3'b110, and S7 = 3'b111. Each state has a unique 3-bit encoding, and no two states share the same encoding. Therefore, the rule is not violated.

**explanation**: Each state in the parameter list is assigned a distinct 3-bit binary encoding. Since no two states have the same encoding, the rule that each state must have a unique encoding is upheld.

**final evaluation**: rule is not violated
